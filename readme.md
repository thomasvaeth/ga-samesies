# Samesies
### About
Samesies is an idea I had during the course of General Assembly Seattle, so I did it for the final project. I wanted to make a handful of templates and have them available to download for a small fee or for free all in once place. The templates can be found [here](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/samesies-coming), [here](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/samesies-profile), and [here](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/samesies-slider).

### Technologies Used
* Express/Node.js
* Mongoose for MongoDB
* AngularJS
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

### Installation
* ````npm install````
  - Node modules include bcrypt, body-parser, express, express-jwt, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, mongoose-validator, ng-smooth-scroll, and node-mongo-seeds.

### Approach Taken
[Wireframes and ERDs](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-samesies/tree/master/screenshots)
I had a lot of fun making this project. I was back and forth on the idea for a couple of days before finally deciding just to do it. I first built a couple of templates that I would need for the store. I wrote instructions for each one because my user stories wanted to include beginner skill levels. After a couple of templates were finished I built the base of the site with placeholder images and text. From there I had a plan everyday where I finished the AngularJS controllers and services, finished the user sign up and sign in, and finished all of the views with styling.

### User Stories
* ````As a user I can download a template and be able to know exactly what to change with no background in HTML or CSS.````
* ````As a user I can preview the template before I download it.````
* ````As a user I can download a template and expect it to be responsive on all devices.````

### Upcoming Additions
* Add responsive design for iPad.
